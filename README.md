Portfolio for GIS/programming work and other projects.

My name is Shelby Snapp and I am a mixed-methods geographer currently pursuing a masters of science in Geography and Environmental Sustainability with a concentration in Environmental Systems from the University of Oklahoma. My interests lie in modelling socio-environmental systems and urban geographies. 
I am familiar with R, the entire ESRI suite of GIS products including ArcPro and ArcGIS online, and am currently learning python. 
In this portfolio, you can find some projects I've completed during my graduate studies for class credit, alongside projects I've completed in my spare time. Enjoy!
